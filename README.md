# School-project, webshop: Gottfrids munkar

## Intro

This project was a part of my studies in the beginners course for JavaScript. The goal was to create a webshop to Mr. Gottfrid that owns a fictional donut-shop in Snaskk√∂ping, to offer a new way to enjoy donuts.

### Problem  / context

Mr. Gottfrids competitors had moved on to delivery services, and he needed to stay competitive. The costumers had stopped coming to the store after other stores and restaurants started to offer delivery.

### Solution

The solution was to create a webshop for Mr. Gottfrid, a user-friendly and easy-to-use website that works on every type of device. This way, his costumers can enjoy delicious donuts without even leaving their home.

#### The process 

The criterias for this assignment was to create a single-page website that should work for mobile units, tablets and desktops. 10 different products was created in JavaScript with unique values to them such as category, price and rating. These products should then be printed out on the website with a few attaching buttons for the user to be able to add items to the shoppingcart. The user should also be able to view the cart, fill in a order-form and if this form is correctly validated the user can now "place an order". 

I started with the design, creating wireframes for the different type devices. Focus was to provide good user experience and good interaction design, designing with "mobile first" in mind. 

Then I wrote the basic structure for the HTML DOM-tree, and moved on to JavaScript and later design with SASS/CSS.

## The result

In this section I will include a few screenshots to demonstrate the end result.
